# About Me

![Portrait](/assets/images/portrait_small.jpeg)

My name is TOYT and I am a Nanyang Technology University graduate with a Bachelor's Degree in Chemistry. I've been teaching since graduating 5 years ago.

Currently, I provide personalized tuition for 

- Secondary School Chemistry
- Primary School Science

My group classes have a maximum of 3 students as I believe that individual attention is important.
